/opt :- optional or third party spftware

/tmp :- temporary files ,gets cleaned at rebbot

/usr :- user related files ,programs

echo :- Displays arguments to the screen 

man :- displays the online manual

exit :- exits the shell

clear :- clears the screen




PATH

it is an environment variable

it contains directories which are separated with : 

if a command is written and enter is pressed  then the command is searched in all the directories that are present in the path variable

if it is found in the first one then ok if not then the next one is searched and so on

the command should exist in atleast one durectory to be executed



WHICH command is used to find where a command is present 
like PATH has directories then which ls will tell us where the ls command is present or stored
